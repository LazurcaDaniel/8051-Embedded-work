Write a C program that turns the LEDs on and off based on the values of switches SW0...SW7 (inputs from
the user).
Indications:
The switches are connected to port P2: each switch corresponds to a bit in P2. By reading a certain bit of P2,
we get value 0 if the corresponding switch is closed and 1 if the switch is open.
